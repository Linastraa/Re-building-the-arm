# Re-building-the-arm
first i uploaded the base and set it up on 90 degrees 
then i uploaded the waist the bigger one and set it up on 90 degrees and stick it above the base 
after that i uploaded the first arm and set it up on 90 degrees of B and 90 degrees of P then stick it to the waist
then i came with the 2nd arm and set it up on 180 degrees of B and 90 degrees of P and stick it to the first arm
later i got the 2nd waist the smaller one and set it up on -90 degrees of H and 180 degrees of B and stick it to the 2nd arm
in the end i uploaded the Gripper and set it up on 90 degrees of H and -180 degrees of P and stick it to the waist on the top
